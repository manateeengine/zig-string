# Security Policy

The Manatee Software Foundation and community takes security bugs in all of our projects seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported via
[GitHub](https://github.com/manateeengine/zig-string/security/advisories/new). The Manatee team
will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report, and will keep you up to
date of the progress towards a fix, and announcement if-needed.

If security issues are found in any dependencies, they should be reported to the maintainers of the
dependency in-question.
